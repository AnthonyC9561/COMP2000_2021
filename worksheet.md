Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?

  Both BitBucket and GitHub are web based version control tools that provides an interface for Git. Both are used to help track and manage changes to the code. This allows comparisons between different versions of the code, useful in fixing issues that may be added into newer versions. Branches are useful as it allows different people to implement different features without interrupting the progress of others. BitBucket are focused on business use and therefore private repositories and is integrated with a bug tracking software called jira. Github is more focused on open sourced projects, allowing collaborations between different groups of people.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?

  Matthew Roberts on 9th July 2021

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  Jon Mountjoy on 11th August 2014

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

  First commits: DavePearce 20th June 2010 
  Last commit: DavePearce 25th July 2021

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

  Both projects have recent activity so both are active. BitBucket's project though seem to lay dorment between 2018 and 2021. Since this is an academic project, maybe a few changes and fixes were needed to update the software. The scale of the software may also be smaller that Whiley. Whiley on Github however is a programming language focued on safety-critical systems which sees frequent updates. Changes however are smaller in later dates... also most likely for maintanance, refactoring and fixes within the code. 

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
